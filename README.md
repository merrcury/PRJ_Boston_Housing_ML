# PRJ_Boston_Housing_ML

## Overview
In this project, I will be evaluating prices of houses in suburbs of Boston by using Machine Learning. Machine learning is achieved using Python 3. Model used for evaluating results is Decision Tree Regressor. 

## MACHINE LEARNING 
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.

## Decision Tree
Regression. Decision tree builds regression or classification models in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes.

## Requirement
At time of developing this program following version of packages/libraries are used.
1. Python       version 3.7.1
2. scikit-learn version 0.20.1
3. numpy        version 1.15.4
4. pandas       version 0.23.4
5. matplotlib   version 3.0.2

## Data Description
The Boston data frame has 506 rows and 14 columns.
This data frame contains the following columns:
crim: per capita crime rate by town.
zn: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
indus: proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
chas: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
nox: nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
rm: average number of rooms per dwelling.
age: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
dis: weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.
rad: index of accessibility to radial highways.
tax: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
ptratio: pupil-teacher ratio by town.
black: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
lstat: lower status of the population (percent).
medv: median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

This is required & correct information upto my knowledge.
